MASS: Masked Sequence to Sequence Pre-training for Language Generation

Kaitao Song* 1Xu Tan* 2Tao Qin2Jianfeng Lu1Tie-Yan Liu2
Abstract
Pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, e.g., BERT (De-
vlin et al., 2018), have achieved great success
in language understanding by transferring knowl-
edge from rich-resource pre-training task to the
low/zero-resource downstream tasks. Inspired
by the success of BERT, we propose MAsked
Sequence to Sequence pre-training (MASS)
for encoder-decoder based language generation.
MASS adopts the encoder-decoder framework
to reconstruct a sentence fragment given the re-
maining part of the sentence: its encoder takes
a sentence with randomly masked fragment (sev-
eral consecutive tokens) as input, and its decoder
tries to predict this masked fragment. In this way,
MASS can jointly train the encoder and decoder to
develop the capability of representation extraction
and language modeling. By further ﬁne-tuning
on a variety of zero/low-resource language gen-
eration tasks, including neural machine transla-
tion, text summarization and conversational re-
sponse generation (3 tasks and totally 8 datasets),
MASS achieves signiﬁcant improvements over
baselines without pre-training or with other pre-
training methods. Specially, we achieve state-of-
the-art accuracy (37.5 in terms of BLEU score)
on the unsupervised English-French translation,
even beating the early attention-based supervised
model (Bahdanau et al., 2015b)1.
1. Introduction
Pre-training and ﬁne-tuning are widely used when target
tasks are of low or zero resource in terms of training data,

Szegedy et al., 2015; Ouyang et al., 2015; Dai & Le, 2015;
Howard & Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al.,
2018). For example, in computer vision, models are usually
pre-trained on the large scale ImageNet dataset and then ﬁne-
tuned on downstream tasks like object detection (Szegedy
et al., 2015; Ouyang et al., 2015) or image segmenta-
tion (Girshick et al., 2014). Recently, pre-training methods
such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), OpenAI GPT (Radford
et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) have attracted a
lot of attention in natural language processing, and achieved
state-of-the-art accuracy in multiple language understanding
tasks such as sentiment classiﬁcation (Socher et al., 2013),
natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015), named
entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang & De Meulder, 2003)
and SQuAD question answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016),
which usually have limited supervised data. Among the
pre-training methods mentioned above, BERT is the most
prominent one by pre-training the bidirectional encoder rep-
resentations on a large monolingual corpus through masked
language modeling and next sentence prediction.
Different from language understanding, language generation
aims to generate natural language sentences conditioned on
some inputs, including tasks like neural machine translation
(NMT) (Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015a; Vaswani
et al., 2017), text summarization (Ayana et al., 2016; Suzuki
& Nagata, 2017; Gehring et al., 2017) and conversational re-
sponse generation (Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals & Le, 2015).
Language generation tasks are usually data-hungry, and
many of them are low-resource or even zero-source in terms
of training data. Directly applying a BERT like pre-training
method on these natural language generation tasks is not fea-
sible, since BERT is designed for language understanding,
which are usually handled by just one encoder or decoder.
Therefore, how to design pre-training methods for the lan-
guage generation tasks (which usually adopt the encoder-
decoder based sequence to sequence learning framework) is
of great potential and importance.
In this paper, inspired by BERT, we propose a novel ob-
jective for pre-training: MAsked Sequence to Sequence
learning (MASS) for language generation. MASS is based
on the sequence to sequence learning framework: its en-
coder takes a sentence with a masked fragment (several
consecutive tokens) as input, and its decoder predicts thisarXiv:1905.02450v5  [cs.CL]  21 Jun 2019MASS: Masked Sequence to Sequence Pre-training for Language Generation
masked fragment conditioned on the encoder representa-
tions. Unlike BERT or a language model that pre-trains
only the encoder or decoder, MASS is carefully designed to
pre-train the encoder and decoder jointly in two steps: 1) By
predicting the fragment of the sentence that is masked on the
encoder side, MASS can force the encoder to understand
the meaning of the unmasked tokens, in order to predict
the masked tokens in the decoder side; 2) By masking the
input tokens of the decoder that are unmasked in the source
side, MASS can force the decoder rely more on the source
representation other than the previous tokens in the target
side for next token prediction, better facilitating the joint
training between encoder and decoder.
MASS just needs to pre-train one model and then ﬁne-tune
on a variety of downstream tasks. We use transformer as the
basic sequence to sequence model and pre-train on the WMT
monolingual corpus2, and then ﬁne-tune on three different
language generation tasks including NMT, text summariza-
tion and conversational response generation. Considering
the downstream tasks cover cross-lingual task like NMT, we
pre-train one model on multiple languages. We explore the
low-resource setting for all the three tasks, and also consider
unsupervised NMT which is a purely zero-resource set-
ting. For NMT, the experiments are conducted on WMT14
English-French, WMT16 English-German and WMT16
English-Romanian datasets. For unsupervised NMT, we
directly ﬁne-tune the pre-trained model on monolingual
data with back-translation loss (Lample et al., 2018), in-
stead of using additional denoising auto-encoder loss as
in Lample et al. (2018). For low-resource NMT, we ﬁne-
tune our model on limited bilingual data. For the other two
tasks, we conduct experiments on: 1) the Gigaword corpus
for abstractive text summarization; 2) the Cornell Movie
Dialog corpus for conversational response generation. Our
method achieves improvements on all these tasks as well
as both the zero- and low-resource settings, demonstrating
our method is effective and applicable to a wide range of
sequence generation tasks.
The contributions of this work are listed as follows: 1) We
propose MASS, a masked sequence to sequence pre-training
method for language generation; 2) We apply MASS on a
variety of language generation tasks including NMT, text
summarization and conversational response generation, and
achieve signiﬁcant improvements, demonstrating the effec-
tiveness of our proposed method. Specially, we achieve a
state-of-the art BLEU score for unsupervised NMT on two
language pairs: English-French and English-German, and
outperform the previous unsupervised NMT method (Lam-
ple & Conneau, 2019) by more than 4 points on English-
French and 1 point on French-English in terms of BLEU

model (Bahdanau et al., 2015b).
2. Related Work
There are a lot of works on sequence to sequence learning
and the pre-training for natural language processing. We
brieﬂy review several popular approaches in this section.
2.1. Sequence to Sequence Learning
Sequence to sequence learning (Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau
et al., 2015a; Wu et al., 2016; Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani
et al., 2017) is a challenging task in artiﬁcial intelligence,
and covers a variety of language generation applications
such as NMT (Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015a;
Wu et al., 2016; Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017;
Tan et al., 2019; Artetxe et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2017;
2018; He et al., 2018; Hassan et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018;
Shen et al., 2018), text summarization (Ayana et al., 2016;
Suzuki & Nagata, 2017; Gehring et al., 2017), question
answering (Yuan et al., 2017; Fedus et al., 2018) and con-
versational response generation (Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals
& Le, 2015).
Sequence to sequence learning has attracted much attention
in recent years due to the advance of deep learning. How-
ever, many language generations tasks such as NMT lack
paired data but have plenty of unpaired data. Therefore, the
pre-training on unpaired data and ﬁne-tuning with small-
scale paired data will be helpful for these tasks, which is
exactly the focus of this work.
2.2. Pre-training for NLP tasks
Pre-training has been widely used in NLP tasks to learn
better language representation. Previous works mostly fo-
cus on natural language understanding tasks, and can be
classiﬁed into feature-based approaches and ﬁne-tuning ap-
proaches. Feature-based approaches mainly leverage pre-
training to provide language representations and features
to the downstream tasks, which includes word-level rep-
resentations (Brown et al., 1992; Ando & Zhang, 2005;
Blitzer et al., 2006; Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mikolov
et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) and sentence-level rep-
resentations (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran & Lee, 2018;
Le & Mikolov, 2014), as well as context sensitive features
from the NMT model (McCann et al., 2017) and ELMo (Pe-
ters et al., 2018). Fine-tuning approaches mainly pre-train
a model on language modeling objective and then ﬁne-
tune the model on the downstream tasks with supervised
data (Dai & Le, 2015; Howard & Ruder, 2018; Radford
et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018). Speciﬁcally, Devlin et al.
(2018) proposed BERT based on masked language modeling
and next sentence prediction and achieved a state-of-the-artMASS: Masked Sequence to Sequence Pre-training for Language Generation

accuracy on multiple language understanding tasks in the
GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018) and SQuAD (Ra-
jpurkar et al., 2016).
There are also some works pre-training the encoder-decoder
model for language generation. Dai & Le (2015); Ra-
machandran et al. (2016) leverage a language model or
auto-encoder to pre-train the encoder and decoder. Their
improvements, although observed, are limited and not as
general and signiﬁcant as the pre-training methods (e.g.,
BERT) for language understanding. Zhang & Zong (2016)
designed a sentence reordering task for pre-training, but
only for the encoder part of the encoder-decoder model.
Zoph et al. (2016); Firat et al. (2016) pre-train the model
on similar rich-resource language pairs and ﬁne-tuned on
the target language pair, which relies on supervised data on
other language pairs. Recently, XLM (Lample & Conneau,
2019) pre-trained BERT-like models both for the encoder
and decoder, and achieved the previous state of the art re-
sults on unsupervised machine translation. However, the
encoder and decoder in XLM are pre-trained separately and
the encoder-decoder attention mechanism cannot be pre-
trained, which are sub-optimal for sequence to sequence
based language generation tasks.
Different from previous works, our proposed MASS is care-
fully designed to pre-train both the encoder and decoder
jointly using only unlabeled data, and can be applied to
most language generations tasks.
3. MASS
In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the basic framework of
sequence to sequence learning, and then propose MASS
(MAsked Sequence to Sequence pre-training). We then
discuss the differences between MASS and previous pre-
training methods including the masked language modeling
in BERT and standard language modeling.
3.1. Sequence to Sequence Learning
We denote (x;y)2(X;Y)as a sentence pair, where
x= (x1;x2;:::;x m)is the source sentence with mto-
kens, andy= (y1;y2;:::;y n)is the target sentence with
ntokens, andXandYare the source and target do-mains. A sequence to sequence model learns the param-
eterto estimate the conditional probability P(yjx;),
and usually uses log likelihood as the objective function:
L(; (X;Y)) =  (x;y)2(X;Y)logP(yjx;). The condi-
tional probability P(yjx;)can be further factorized accord-
ing to the chain rule: P(yjx;) =Qn
t=1P(ytjy<t;x;),
wherey<tis the proceeding tokens before position t.
A major approach to sequence to sequence learning is the
encoder-decoder framework: The encoder reads the source
sequence and generates a set of representations; the decoder
estimates the conditional probability of each target token
given the source representations and its preceding tokens.
Attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015a) is further
introduced between the encoder and decoder to ﬁnd which
source representation to focus on when predicting the cur-
rent token.
3.2. Masked Sequence to Sequence Pre-training
We introduce a novel unsupervised prediction task in this
section. Given an unpaired source sentence x2X , we
denotexnu:vas a modiﬁed version of xwhere its fragment
from position utovare masked, 0<u<v<m andmis
the number of tokens of sentence x. We denotek=v u+1
as the number of tokens being masked from position uto
v. We replace each masked token by a special symbol [M],
and the length of the masked sentence is not changed. xu:v
denotes the sentence fragment of xfromutov.
MASS pre-trains a sequence to sequence model by predict-
ing the sentence fragment xu:vtaking the masked sequence
xnu:vas input. We also use the log likelihood as the objec-
tive function:
L(;X) =1
jXjx2XlogP(xu:vjxnu:v;)
=1
jXjx2XlogvY
t=uP(xu:v
tjxu:v
<t;xnu:v;):(1)
We show an example in Figure 1, where the input sequence
has 8 tokens with the fragment x3x4x5x6being masked.
Note that the model only predicts the masked fragment
x3x4x5x6, givenx3x4x5as the decoder input for position
4 6, and the decoder takes the special mask symbol [M]
as inputs for the other positions (e.g., position 1 3andMASS: Masked Sequence to Sequence Pre-training for Language Generation

7 8). While our method works for any neural network
based encoder-decoder frameworks, we choose Transformer
in our experiments, considering that it achieves state-of-the-
art performances in multiple sequence to sequence learning
tasks.
Actually, the masked language modeling in BERT (Devlin
et al., 2018) and the standard language modeling (Bengio
et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2010) in GPT (Radford et al.,
2018) can be viewed as special cases of MASS. We have
an important hyperparameter k, which denotes the length
of the masked fragment of the sentence. Our method with
differentkvalues can cover the special cases that are related
to previous pre-training methods, as shown in Table 1.
Whenk= 1, the masked fragment in the source sentence
contains only one token, and the decoder predicts this token
without any tokens as input but conditioned on the unmasked
source tokens, as shown in Figure 2a. It becomes the masked
language modeling as used in BERT. One may argue that
the model structure is a little bit different from the masked
language model. However, since all the input tokens of the
decoder are masked, the decoder is itself like a non-linear
classiﬁer, analogous to the softmax matrix used in BERT.
In this case, the conditional probability is P(xujxnu;)and
uis the position of the masked token, which is exactly the
formulation of masked language modeling used in BERT3.
Whenk=mwheremis the number of tokens in sen-
tencex, all the tokens on the encoder side are masked and
the decoder needs to predict all tokens given previous to-
kens, as shown in Figure 2b. The conditional probability
isP(x1:mjxn1:m;), and it becomes the standard language
modeling in GPT, conditioned on null information from the
encoder as all the tokens in the encoder side are masked.
3.3. Discussions
MASS is a pre-training method for language generation.
While its special cases are related to the previous methods
including the standard language modeling in GPT and the
masked language modeling in BERT, it is different from
3One may argue that the masked language modeling in BERT
randomly masks multiple tokens rather than just one token at a
time. However, the key idea behind masking language modeling
in BERT is to leverage bidirectional context information. Masking
multiple tokens at a time is mainly for training speedup.Length Probability Model

these methods in general.
Standard language modeling has long been used for
pre-training, and the most prominent ones are the re-
cently proposed ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and Ope-
nAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018). BERT introduces
two pre-training tasks (masked language modeling and
next sentence prediction) for natural language under-
standing, and uses one encoder to extract the repre-
sentation for a single sentence or a pair of sentences.
Both standard language modeling and BERT can just
pre-train the encoder or decoder separately. While
achieving promising results on language understand-
ing tasks, they are not suitable for language genera-
tion tasks which typically leverage an encoder-decoder
framework for conditional sequence generation.
MASS is designed to jointly pre-train the encoder and
decoder for language generation tasks. First, by only
predicting the masked tokens through a sequence to
sequence framework, MASS forces the encoder to un-
derstand the meaning of the unmasked tokens, and
also encourages the decoder to extract useful infor-
mation from the encoder side. Second, by predicting
consecutive tokens in the decoder side, the decoder
can build better language modeling capability than just
predicting discrete tokens. Third, by further masking
the input tokens of the decoder which are not masked
in the encoder side (e.g., when predicting fragment
x3x4x5x6, only the tokens x3x4x5are taken as the in-
put and other tokens are masked with [M]), the decoder
is encouraged to extract more useful information from
the encoder side, rather than leveraging the abundant
information from the previous tokens.MASS: Masked Sequence to Sequence Pre-training for Language Generation
4. Experiments and Results
In this section, we describe the experimental details about
MASS pre-training and ﬁne-tuning on a variety of language
generation tasks, including NMT, text summarization, con-
versational response generation.
4.1. MASS Pre-training
Model Conﬁguration We choose Transformer (Vaswani
et al., 2017) as the basic model structure, which consists
of 6-layer encoder and 6-layer decoder with 1024 embed-
ding/hidden size and 4096 feed-forward ﬁlter size. For
neural machine translation task, we pre-train our model on
the monolingual data of the source and target languages. We
respectively conduct experiments on three language pairs:
English-French, English-German, and English-Romanian.
For other language generation tasks, including text summa-
rization and conversational response generation, we pre-
train the model with only English monolingual data re-
spectively. To distinguish between the source and target
languages in neural machine translation task, we add a lan-
guage embedding to each token of the input sentence for the
encoder and decoder, which is also learnt end-to-end. We
implement our method based on codebase of XLM4.
Datasets We use all of the monolingual data from WMT
News Crawl datasets5, which covers 190M, 62M and 270M
sentences from year 2007 to 2017 for English, French, Ger-
man respectively. We also include a low-resource language,
Romanian, in the pre-training stage, to verify the effective-
ness of MASS pre-trained with low-resource monolingual
data. We use all of the available Romanian sentences from
News Crawl dataset and augment it with WMT16 data,
which results in 2.9M sentences. We remove the sentences
with length over 175. For each task, we jointly learn a
60,000 sub-word units with Byte-Pair Encoding (Sennrich
et al., 2016) between source and target languages.
Pre-Training Details We mask the fragment by replac-
ing the consecutive tokens with special symbols [M], with
random start position u. Following Devlin et al. (2018), the
masked tokens in the encoder will be a [M]token 80% of
the time, a random token 10% of the time and a unchanged
token 10% of the time. We set the fragment length kas
roughly 50% of the total number of tokens in the sentence
and also study different kto compare their accuracy changes.
To reduce the memory and computation cost, we removed
the padding in the decoder (the masked tokens) but keep the
positional embedding of the unmasked tokens unchanged
(e.g., if the ﬁrst two tokens are masked and removed, the

5While we choose the WMT monolingual data in the current
setting, pre-training on Wikipedia data is also feasible.position for the third token is still 2 but not 0). In this way,
we can get similar accuracy and reduce 50% computation
in the decoder. We use Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba,
2015) with a learning rate of 10 4for the pre-training. The
model are trained on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPU cards and each
mini-batch contains 3000 tokens for pre-training.
To verify the effectiveness of MASS, we ﬁne-tune the pre-
trained model on three language generation tasks: NMT,
text summarization and conversational response generation.
We explore the low-resource setting on these tasks where
we just leverage few training data for ﬁne-tuning to simulate
the low-resource scenario. For NMT, we mainly investigate
the zero-resource (unsupervised) setting, as unsupervised
NMT has become a challenging task in recent years (Artetxe
et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2017; 2018).
4.2. Fine-Tuning on NMT
In this section, we ﬁrst describe the experiments on the
unsupervised NMT, and then introduce the experiments on
low-resource NMT.
Experimental Setting For unsupervised NMT, there is no
bilingual data to ﬁne-tune the pre-trained model. Therefore,
we leverage the monolingual data that is also used in the
pre-training stage. Different from Artetxe et al. (2017);
Lample et al. (2017; 2018); Leng et al. (2019), we just
use back-translation to generate pseudo bilingual data for
training, without using denoising auto-encoder6. During
ﬁne-tuning, we use Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015)
with initial learning rate 10 4, and the batch size is set as
2000 tokens for each GPU. During evaluation, we calculate
the BLEU score with multi-bleu.pl7onnewstest2014 for
English-French, and newstest2016 for English-German and
English-Romanian.
Results on Unsupervised NMT Our results are shown
in Table 2. On all the 6 translation directions, our method
outperforms all of the previous results, including the meth-
ods without pre-training (Lample et al., 2018) and with
pre-training (Lample & Conneau, 2019). XLM (Lample
& Conneau, 2019) is the previous state-of-the-art method
which leverage BERT like pre-training in encoder and de-
coder, which covers several pre-training methods: masked
language model (MLM) and causal language model (CLM).
Our method still outperforms XLM by 4.1 BLEU points on
en-fr.
Compared with Other Pre-training Methods We also
compare MASS with the previous pre-training methods for
6MASS is better than denoising auto-encoder as we will show
in Table 3.

language generation tasks. The ﬁrst baseline is BERT+LM ,
which use masked language modeling in BERT to pre-train
the encoder and the standard language modeling to pre-train
the decoder. The second baseline is DAE , which simply
uses denoising auto-encoder (Vincent et al., 2008) to pre-
train the encoder and decoder. We pre-train the model with
BERT+LM andDAE , and ﬁne-tune on the unsupervised
translation pairs with same ﬁne-tuning strategy of XLM
(i.e., DAE loss + back-translation). These methods are also
conﬁgured with the 6-layer Transformer setting.
As shown in Table 3, BERT+LM achieves higher BLEU
score than DAE , and MASS outperforms both BERT+LM
andDAE on all the unsupervised translation pairs. While
DAE usually leverages some denoising methods like ran-
domly masking tokens or swapping adjacent tokens, the
decoder can still easily learn to copy the unmasked tokens
through encoder-decoder attention8. On the other hand, the
decoder in DAE takes the full sentence as the input, which
is enough to predict the next token like the language model,
and is not forced to extract additional useful representation
from the encoder.
Experiments on Low-Resource NMT In the low-
resource NMT setting, we respectively sample 10K, 100K,
1M paired sentence from the bilingual training data of
WMT14 English-French, WMT16 English-German and
WMT16 English-Romanian, to explore the performance of
our method in different low-resource scenarios. We use the
same BPE codes learned in the pre-trained stage to tokenize
the training sentence pairs. We ﬁne-tune the pre-trained
model on the paired data for 20,000 steps with Adam op-
timizer and the learning rate is set as 10 4. We choose
the best model according to the accuracy on development
set. We report the BLEU scores on the same testsets used
in the unsupervised setting. As shown in Figure 3, MASS
outperforms the baseline models that are trained only on
8The popular encoder-decoder based model structures (Wu
et al., 2016; Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017) all adopt
residual connection (He et al., 2016). Therefore, the token genera-
tion in the top layer of the decoder side can directly depend on the
token embedding in the encoder side through residual connection

translation directions, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our method in the low-resource scenarios.
4.3. Fine-Tuning on Text Summarization
Experiment Setting Text summarization is the task of
creating a short and ﬂuent summary of a long text document,
which is a typical sequence generation task. We ﬁne-tune the
pre-trained model on text summarization task with different
scales (10K, 100K, 1M and 3.8M) of training data from the
Gigaword corpus (Graff et al., 2003)9, which consists of
a total of 3.8M article-title pairs in English. We take the
article as the encoder input and title as the decoder input for
ﬁne-tuning. We report the F1 score of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-
2 and ROUGE-L on the Gigaword testset during evaluation.
We use beam search with a beam size of 5 for inference.
Results Our results are illustrated in Figure 4. We com-
pare MASS with the model that is trained only on the paired
data without any pre-training. MASS consistently outper-
forms the baseline on different scales of ﬁne-tuning data
(more than 10 ROUGE points gain on 10K data and 5
ROUGE points gain on 100K data), which demonstrates
that MASS is effective in low-resource scenarios with dif-
ferent scale of training data on this task.
Compared with Other Pre-Training Methods We fur-
ther compare MASS with the pre-training methods of
BERT+LM andDAE described in Section 4.2, with 3.8M

4.4. Fine-Tuning on Conversational Response
Generation
Experimental Setting Conversational response gener-
ation generates a ﬂexible response for the conversa-
tion (Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals & Le, 2015). We conduct
experiments on the Cornell movie dialog corpus (Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil & Lee, 2011)10that contains 140K conver-
sation pairs. We randomly sample 10K/20K pairs as the
validation/test set and the remaining data is used for training.
We adopt the same optimization hyperparameters from the
pre-training stage for ﬁne-tuning. We report the results with
perplexity (PPL) following Vinyals & Le (2015).
Results We compare MASS with the baseline that is
trained on the available data pairs. We conduct experiments

cornell movie corpuson the 10K pairs (randomly chosen) and the whole 110K
pairs, and show the results in Table 5. MASS achieves lower
PPL than the baseline on both the 10K and 110K data.

Compared with Other Pre-Training Methods We also
compare MASS with the pre-training methods of BERT+LM
andDAE on conversational response generation. As shown
in Table 5, MASS consistently outperforms the two pre-
training methods with lower PPL on 10K and 110K training
data respectively.
4.5. Analysis of MASS
Study of Different kThe length of the masked fragment
kis an important hyperparameter of MASS and we have
variedkin Section 3.2 to cover the special cases of masked
language modeling in BERT and standard language mod-
eling. In this section, we study the performance of MASS
with different k, where we choose kfrom 10% to 90% per-
centage of the sentence length mwith a step size of 10%,
plus withk= 1andk=m.
We observe both the performance of MASS after pre-
training, as well as the performance after ﬁne-tuning on
several language generation tasks, including unsupervised
English-French translation, text summarization and conver-
sational response generation. We ﬁrst show the perplexity
(PPL) of the pre-training model on the English and French
languages with different k. We choose the English and
French sentences from newstest2013 of WMT En-Fr as
the validation set, and plot the PPL in Figure 5a (English)
and 5b (French). It can be seen that the pre-trained model
achieves the best validation PPL when kis between 50%
and70% of the sentence length m. We then observe the
performance on ﬁne-tuning tasks. We show the curve of

the validation set of text summarization (Figure d); the PPL on the validation set of conversational response generation (Figure e).

lation in Figure 5c, the validation ROUGE scores on text
summarization in Figure 5d, and the validation PPL on con-
versational response generation in Figure 5e. It can be seen
that MASS achieves best performance on these downstream
tasks whenkis nearly 50% of the sentence length m. There-
fore, we set k= 50% ofmfor MASS in our experiments.
Actually,k= 50% ofmis a good balance between the
encoder and decoder. Too few valid tokens in the encoder
side or in the decoder side will bias the model to concentrate
more on the other side, which is not suitable for language
generation task that typically leverages the encoder-decoder
framework to extract the sentence representation in the en-
coder, as well as to model and generate the sentence in the
decoder. The extreme cases are k= 1 (masked language
modeling in BERT) and k=m(standard language model-
ing), as illustrated in Figure 2. Neither k= 1nork=m
can achieve good performance on the downstream language
generation tasks, as shown in Figure 5.
Ablation Study of MASS In our masked sequence to se-
quence pre-training, we have two careful designs: (1) We
mask consecutive tokens in the encoder side, and thus pre-
dict consecutive tokens in the decoder side, which can build
better language modeling capability than just predicting
discrete tokens. (2) We mask the input tokens of the de-
coder which are not masked in the encoder side (e.g., when
predicting fragment x3x4x5x6in Figure 1, only the tokens
x3x4x5are taken as the input and other tokens are masked
with[M]), to encourage the decoder to extract more useful
information from the encoder side, rather than leveraging
the abundant information from the previous tokens. In this
section, we conduct two ablation studies to verify the ef-
fectiveness of the two designs in MASS. The ﬁrst study isto randomly mask discrete tokens instead of consecutive
tokens in MASS, denoted as Discrete . The second study
is to feed all the tokens to the decoder instead of masking
the input tokens of the decoder that are not masked in the
encoder side, denoted as Feed . We compare MASS with the
two ablation methods on the unsupervised English-French
translation, as shown in Table 6. It can be seen that both Dis-
crete andFeed perform worse than MASS, demonstrating
the effectiveness of the two designs in MASS.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we have proposed MASS: masked sequence to
sequence pre-training for language generation tasks, which
reconstructs a sentence fragment given the remaining part
of the sentence in the encoder-decoder framework. MASS
just needs to pre-train one model and then ﬁne-tune on
multiple language generation tasks such as neural machine
translation, text summarization and conversational response
generation. Through experiments on the three above tasks
and total eight datasets, MASS achieved signiﬁcant improve-
ments over the baseline without pre-training or with other
pre-training methods. More speciﬁcally, MASS achieved
the state-of-the-art BLEU scores for unsupervised NMT on
three language pairs, outperforming the previous state-of-
the-art by more than 4 BLEU points on English-French.
For future work, we will apply MASS to more language
generation tasks such as sentence paraphrasing, text style
transfer and post editing, as well as other sequence genera-
tion tasks (Ren et al., 2019). We will also investigate more
of the theoretical and empirical analysis on our masked
sequence to sequence pre-training method.
