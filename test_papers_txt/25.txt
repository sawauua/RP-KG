Abstract
Machine learning models are often susceptible to adversarial perturbations of their
inputs. Even small perturbations can cause state-of-the-art classiﬁers with high
“standard” accuracy to produce an incorrect prediction with high conﬁdence. To
better understand this phenomenon, we study adversarially robust learning from the
viewpoint of generalization. We show that already in a simple natural data model,
the sample complexity of robust learning can be signiﬁcantly larger than that of
“standard” learning. This gap is information theoretic and holds irrespective of the
training algorithm or the model family. We complement our theoretical results with
experiments on popular image classiﬁcation datasets and show that a similar gap
exists here as well. We postulate that the difﬁculty of training robust classiﬁers
stems, at least partially, from this inherently larger sample complexity.
1 Introduction
Modern machine learning models achieve high accuracy on a broad range of datasets, yet can easily
be misled by small perturbations of their input. While such perturbations are often simple noise to a
human or even imperceptible, they cause state-of-the-art models to misclassify their input with high
conﬁdence. This phenomenon has ﬁrst been studied in the context of secure machine learning for
spam ﬁlters and malware classiﬁcation [ 7,16,35]. More recently, researchers have demonstrated
the phenomenon under the name of adversarial examples in image classiﬁcation [ 21,51], question
answering [ 28], voice recognition [ 12,13,49,62], and other domains (for instance, see [ 2,4,14,
22,25,26,32,60]). Overall, the existence of such adversarial examples raises concerns about the
robustness of current classiﬁers. As we increasingly deploy machine learning systems in safety- and
security-critical environments, it is crucial to understand the robustness properties of our models in
more detail.
A growing body of work is exploring this robustness question from the security perspective by
proposing attacks (methods for crafting adversarial examples) and defenses (methods for making
classiﬁers robust to such perturbations). Often, the focus is on deep neural networks, e.g., see [ 11,24,
36,37,41,47,53,59]. While there has been success with robust classiﬁers on simple datasets [ 31,
36,44,48], more complicated datasets still exhibit a large gap between “standard” and robust
accuracy [ 3,11]. An implicit assumption underlying most of this work is that the same training
dataset that enables good standard accuracy also sufﬁces to train a robust model. However, it is
unclear if this assumption is valid.
32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018), Montréal, Canada.So far, the generalization aspects of adversarially robust classiﬁcation have not been thoroughly
investigated. Since adversarial robustness is a learning problem, the statistical perspective is of
integral importance. A key observation is that adversarial examples are not at odds with the standard
notion of generalization as long as they occupy only a small total measure under the data distribution.
So to achieve adversarial robustness, a classiﬁer must generalize in a stronger sense. We currently do
not have a good understanding of how such a stronger notion of generalization compares to standard
“benign” generalization, i.e., without an adversary.
In this work, we address this gap and explore the statistical foundations of adversarially robust
generalization. We focus on sample complexity as a natural starting point since it underlies the core
question of when it is possible to learn an adversarially robust classiﬁer. Concretely, we pose the
following question:
How does the sample complexity of standard generalization compare to that of
adversarially robust generalization?
Put differently, we ask if a dataset that allows for learning a good classiﬁer also sufﬁces for learning a
robust one. To study this question, we analyze robust generalization in two distributional models. By
focusing on speciﬁc distributions, we can establish information-theoretic lower bounds and describe
the exact sample complexity requirements for generalization. We ﬁnd that even for a simple data
distribution such as a mixture of two class-conditional Gaussians, the sample complexity of robust
generalization is signiﬁcantly larger than that of standard generalization. Our lower bound holds for
anymodel and learning algorithm. Hence no amount of algorithmic ingenuity is able to overcome
this limitation.
In spite of this negative result, simple datasets such as MNIST have recently seen signiﬁcant progress
in terms of adversarial robustness [ 31,36,44,48]. The most robust models achieve accuracy around
90% against large `1-perturbations. To better understand this discrepancy with our ﬁrst theoretical
result, we also study a second distributional model with binary features. This binary data model
has the same standard generalization behavior as the previous Gaussian model. Moreover, it also
suffers from a signiﬁcantly increased sample complexity whenever one employs linear classiﬁers
to achieve adversarially robust generalization. Nevertheless, a slightly non-linear classiﬁer that
utilizes thresholding turns out to recover the smaller sample complexity of standard generalization.
Since MNIST is a mostly binary dataset, our result provides evidence that `1-robustness on MNIST
is signiﬁcantly easier than on other datasets. Moreover, our results show that distributions with
similar sample complexity for standard generalization can still exhibit considerably different sample
complexity for robust generalization.
To complement our theoretical results, we conduct a range of experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10,
and SVHN. By subsampling the datasets at various rates, we study the impact of sample size
on adversarial robustness. When plotted as a function of training set size, our results show that
the standard accuracy on SVHN indeed plateaus well before the adversarial accuracy reaches its
maximum. On MNIST, explicitly adding thresholding to the model during training signiﬁcantly
reduces the sample complexity, similar to our upper bound in the binary data model. On CIFAR10,
the situation is more nuanced because there are no known approaches that achieve more than 50%
accuracy even against a mild adversary. But as we show below, there is clear evidence for overﬁtting
in the current state-of-the-art methods.
Overall, our results suggest that current approaches may be unable to attain higher adversarial
accuracy on datasets such as CIFAR10 for a fundamental reason: the dataset may not be large
enough to train a standard convolutional network robustly. Moreover, our lower bounds illustrate
that the existence of adversarial examples should not necessarily be seen as a shortcoming of speciﬁc
classiﬁcation methods. Already in a simple data model, adversarial examples provably occur for
any learning approach, even when the classiﬁer already achieves high standard accuracy. So while
vulnerability to adversarial `1-perturbations might seem counter-intuitive at ﬁrst, in some regimes it
is an unavoidable consequence of working in a statistical setting.
1.1 A motivating example: Overﬁtting on CIFAR10
Before we describe our main results, we brieﬂy highlight the importance of generalization for
adversarial robustness via two experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10. In both cases, our goal is to
learn a classiﬁer that achieves good test accuracy even under `1-bounded perturbations. We follow

we trained standard convolutional networks to be robust to `1-perturbations of the input. On MNIST,
the robust test error closely tracks the corresponding training error and the model achieves high robust
accuracy. On CIFAR10, the model still achieves a good natural (non-adversarial) test error, but there
is a signiﬁcant generalization gap for the robust accuracy. This phenomenon motivates our study of
adversarially robust generalization.

Figure 1 displays the training curves for three quantities: (i) adversarial training error, (ii) adversarial
test error, and (iii) standard test error.
The results show that on MNIST, robust optimization is able to learn a model with around 90%
adversarial accuracy and a relatively small gap between training and test error. However, CIFAR10
offers a different picture. Here, the model (a wide residual network [ 61]) is still able to fully ﬁt the
training set even against an adversary, but the generalization gap is signiﬁcantly larger. The model
only achieves 47% adversarial test accuracy, which is about 50% lower than its training accuracy.1
Moreover, the standard test accuracy is about 87%, so the failure of generalization indeed primarily
occurs in the context of adversarial robustness. This failure may be surprising particularly since
properly tuned convolutional networks rarely overﬁt much on standard vision datasets.
1.2 Outline of the paper
In the next section, we describe our main theoretical results at a high level. Section 3 complements
these results with experiments. We discuss related works in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5. Due
to space constraints, a longer discussion of related work, several open questions, and all proofs are
deferred to the appendix in the supplementary material.
2 Theoretical Results
Our theoretical results concern statistical aspects of adversarially robust classiﬁcation. In order to
understand how properties of data affect the number of samples needed for robust generalization, we
study two concrete distributional models.
While our two data models are clearly much simpler than the image datasets currently being used in
the experimental work on `1-robustness, we believe that the simplicity of our models is a strength in
this context. The fact that we can establish a separation between standard and robust generalization
already in our Gaussian data model is evidence that the existence of adversarial examples for neural
1We remark that this accuracy is still currently the best published robust accuracy on CIFAR10 [ 3]. For
instance, contemporary approaches to architecture tuning do not yield better robust accuracies [15].
3networks should not come as a surprise. The same phenomenon (i.e., classiﬁers with just enough
samples for high standard accuracy necessarily being vulnerable to `1- attacks) already occurs in
much simpler settings such as a mixture of two Gaussians. Note that more complicated distributional
setups that can “simulate” the Gaussian model directly inherit our lower bounds.
In addition, conclusions from our simple models also transfer to real datasets. As we describe
in the subsection on the Bernoulli model, the beneﬁts of the thresholding layer predicted by our
theoretical analysis do indeed appear in experiments on MNIST as well. Since multiple defenses
against adversarial examples have been primarily evaluated on MNIST [ 31,44,48], it is important to
note that`1-robustness on MNIST is a particularly easy case: adding a simple thresholding layer
directly yields nearly state-of-the-art robustness against moderately strong adversaries ( "= 0:1),
without any further changes to the model architecture or training algorithm.
2.1 The Gaussian model
Our ﬁrst data model is a mixture of two spherical Gaussians with one component per class.
Deﬁnition 1 (Gaussian model) .Let?2Rdbe the per-class mean vector and let  > 0be the
variance parameter. Then the (?;)-Gaussian model is deﬁned by the following distribution over
(x;y)2Rdf 1g: First, draw a label y2f 1guniformly at random. Then sample the data point
x2RdfromN(y?;2I).
While not explicitly speciﬁed in the deﬁnition, we will use the Gaussian model in the regime where
the norm of the vector ?is approximatelyp
d. Hence the main free parameter for controlling the
difﬁculty of the classiﬁcation task is the variance 2, which controls the amount of overlap between
the two classes.
To contrast the notions of “standard” and “robust” generalization, we brieﬂy recap a standard deﬁnition
of classiﬁcation error.
Deﬁnition 2 (Classiﬁcation error) .LetP:Rdf 1g!Rbe a distribution. Then the classiﬁcation
errorof a classiﬁer f:Rd!f 1gis deﬁned as =P(x;y)P[f(x)6=y].
Next, we deﬁne our main quantity of interest, which is an adversarially robust counterpart of the
above classiﬁcation error. Instead of counting misclassiﬁcations under the data distribution, we allow
a bounded worst-case perturbation before passing the perturbed sample to the classiﬁer.
Deﬁnition 3 (Robust classiﬁcation error) .LetP:Rdf 1g!Rbe a distribution and let
B:Rd!P(Rd)be a perturbation set.2Then theB-robust classiﬁcation error of a classiﬁer
f:Rd!f 1gis deﬁned as =P(x;y)P[9x02B(x) :f(x0)6=y].
Since`1-perturbations have recently received a signiﬁcant amount of attention, we focus on ro-
bustness to`1-bounded adversaries in our work. For this purpose, we deﬁne the perturbation set
B"
1(x) =fx02Rdjkx0 xk1"g. To simplify notation, we refer to robustness with respect to
this set also as `"
1-robustness. As we remark in the discussion section, understanding generalization
for other measures of robustness ( `2, rotations, etc.) is an important direction for future work.
Standard generalization. The Gaussian model has one parameter for controlling the difﬁculty of
learning a good classiﬁer. In order to simplify the following bounds, we study a regime where it is
possible to achieve good standard classiﬁcation error from a single sample.3As we will see later,
this also allows us to calibrate our two data models to have comparable standard sample complexity.
Concretely, we prove the following theorem, which is a direct consequence of Gaussian concentration.
Note that in this theorem we use a linear classiﬁer : for a vector w, the linear classiﬁer fw:Rd!
f1gis deﬁned as fw(x) =sgn(hw;xi).

linear classiﬁer fbwhas classiﬁcation error at most 1%.
2We write P(Rd)to denote the power set of Rd, i.e., the set of subsets of Rd.
3We remark that it is also possible to study a more general setting where standard generalization requires a
larger number of samples.
4To minimize the number of parameters in our bounds, we have set the error probability to 1%.
By tuning the model parameters appropriately, it is possible to achieve a vanishingly small error
probability from a single sample (see Corollary 19 in Appendix D.1).
Robust generalization. As we just demonstrated, we can easily achieve standard generalization
from only a single sample in our Gaussian model. We now show that achieving a low `1-robust
classiﬁcation error requires signiﬁcantly more samples. To this end, we begin with a natural strength-
ening of Theorem 4 and prove that the (class-weighted) sample mean can also be a robust classiﬁer
(given sufﬁcient data).

We refer the reader to Corollary 22 in Appendix D.1 for the details. As before, c1andc2are two
universal constants. Overall, the theorem shows that it is possible to learn an `"
1-robust classiﬁer
in the Gaussian model as long as "is bounded by a small constant and we have a large number of
samples.
Next, we show that this signiﬁcantly increased sample complexity is necessary. Our main theorem
establishes a lower bound for alllearning algorithms, which we formalize as functions from data
samples to binary classiﬁers. In particular, the lower bound applies not only to learning linear
classiﬁers.

The proof of the theorem can be found in Corollary 23 (Appendix D.2). It is worth noting that the

trivially achieves perfect robustness on one of the two classes and hence robust accuracy1=2.
Comparing Theorems 5 and 6, we see that the sample complexity nrequired for robust generalization

adversarial robustness can provably require a signiﬁcantly larger number of samples.
Finally, we remark that our lower bound applies also to a more restricted adversary. Our proof uses
only a single adversarial perturbation per class. As a result, the lower bound provides transferable ad-
versarial examples and applies to worst-case distribution shifts without a classiﬁer-adaptive adversary.
We refer the reader to Section 5 for a more detailed discussion.
2.2 The Bernoulli model
As mentioned in the introduction, simpler datasets such as MNIST have recently seen signiﬁcant
progress in terms of `1-robustness. We now investigate a possible mechanism underlying these
advances. To this end, we study a second distributional model that highlights how the data distribution
can signiﬁcantly affect the achievable robustness. The second data model is deﬁned on the hypercube
f1gd, and the two classes are represented by opposite vertices of that hypercube. When sampling a
datapoint for a given class, we ﬂip each bit of the corresponding class vertex with a certain probability.
This data model is inspired by the MNIST dataset because MNIST images are close to binary (many
pixels are almost fully black or white).

class bias parameter. Then the (?;)-Bernoulli model is deﬁned by the following distribution over

As in the previous subsection, the model has one parameter for controlling the difﬁculty of learning.
A small value of makes the samples less correlated with their respective class vectors and hence
leads to a harder classiﬁcation problem. Note that both the Gaussian and the Bernoulli model are
deﬁned by simple sub-Gaussian distributions. Nevertheless, we will see that they differ signiﬁcantly
in terms of robust sample complexity.
Standard generalization. As in the Gaussian model, we ﬁrst calibrate the distribution so that we
can learn a classiﬁer with good standard accuracy from a single sample.4The following theorem is a
direct consequence of the fact that bounded random variables exhibit sub-Gaussian concentration.
Theorem 8. Let(x;y)be drawn from a (?;)-Bernoulli model with cd 1=4wherecis a
universal constant. Let bw2Rdbe the vectorbw=yx. Then with high probability, the linear
classiﬁerfbwhas classiﬁcation error at most 1%.
To simplify the bound, we have set the error probability to be 1% as in the Gaussian model. We refer
the reader to Corollary 28 in Appendix F.1 for the proof.
Robust generalization. Next, we investigate the sample complexity of robust generalization in
our Bernoulli model. For linear classiﬁers, a small robust classiﬁcation error again requires a large
number of samples:
Theorem 9. Letgnbe a linear classiﬁer learning algorithm, i.e., a function from nsamples to a

We defer the proof to Appendix F.2. At ﬁrst, the lower bound for linear classiﬁers might suggest that
`1-robustness requires an inherently larger sample complexity here as well. However, in contrast
to the Gaussian model, non-linear classiﬁers can achieve a signiﬁcantly improved robustness. In
particular, consider the following thresholding operation T:Rd!Rdwhich is deﬁned element-wise
as
T(x)i=+1 ifxi0

It is easy to see that for "<1, the thresholding operator undoes the action of any `1-bounded adver-
sary, i.e., we have T(B"

operator with the classiﬁer learned from a single sample to get the following upper bound.
Theorem 10. Let(x;y)be drawn from a (?;)-Bernoulli model with cd 1=4wherecis a

This theorem shows a stark contrast to the Gaussian case. Although both models have similar sample
complexity for standard generalization, there is ap
dgap between the `1-robust sample complexity
for the Bernoulli and Gaussian models. This discrepancy provides evidence that robust generalization
requires a more nuanced understanding of the data distribution than standard generalization.
4To be precise, the two distributions have comparable sample complexity for standard generalization in the
regime where  1.

`1adversaries on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. For each choice of training set size
and"test, we plot the best performance achieved over "train and network capacity. This clearly
shows that achieving a certain level of adversarially robust generalization requires signiﬁcantly more
samples than achieving the same level of standard generalization.
In isolation, the thresholding step might seem speciﬁc to the Bernoulli model studied here. However,
our experiments in Section 3 show that an explicit thresholding layer also signiﬁcantly improves the
sample complexity of training a robust neural network on MNIST. We conjecture that the effectiveness
of thresholding is behind many of the successful defenses against adversarial examples on MNIST
(for instance, see Appendix C in [36]).
3 Experiments
We complement our theoretical results by performing experiments on multiple common datasets. We
consider standard convolutional neural networks and train models on datasets of varying complexity.
Speciﬁcally, we study the MNIST [ 34], CIFAR-10 [ 33], and SVHN [ 40] datasets. We use a simple
convolutional architecture for MNIST, a standard ResNet model [ 23] for CIFAR-10, and a wider
ResNet [ 61] for SVHN. We perform robust optimization to train our classiﬁers on perturbations
generated by projected gradient descent. Appendix G provides additional details for our experiments.
Empirical sample complexity evaluation. We study how the generalization performance of adver-
sarially robust networks varies with the size of the training dataset. To do so, we train networks with
a speciﬁc`1adversary while reducing the size of the training set. The training subsets are produced
by randomly sub-sampling the complete dataset in a class-balanced fashion. When increasing the
number of samples, we ensure that each dataset is a superset of the previous one.
We evaluate the robustness of each trained network to perturbations of varying magnitude ( "test). For
each choice of training set size Nand ﬁxed attack "test, we select the best performance achieved
across all hyperparameters settings (training perturbations "train and model size). On all three
datasets, we observed that the best standard accuracy is usually achieved for the standard trained
network, while the best adversarial accuracy for almost all values of "testwas achieved when training
with the largest "train . We maximize over the hyperparameter settings since we are not interested in
the performance of a speciﬁc model, but rather in the inherent generalization properties of the dataset
independently of the classiﬁer used. Figure 2 shows the results of these experiments.
The plots demonstrate the need for more data to achieve adversarially robust generalization. For any
ﬁxed test set accuracy, the number of samples needed is signiﬁcantly higher for robust generalization.
In the SVHN experiments (where we have sufﬁcient training samples to observe plateauing behavior),
the standard accuracy reaches its maximum with signiﬁcantly fewer samples than the adversarial
accuracy. We report more details of our experiments in Section H of the supplementary material.
Thresholding experiments. Motivated by our theoretical study of the Bernoulli model, we investi-
gate whether thresholding can also improve the sample complexity of robust generalization against
an`1adversary on MNIST.

observe that introducing thresholding ﬁlters signiﬁcantly reduces the number of samples needed to
achieve good adversarial generalization.
We repeat the above sample complexity experiments with networks where thresholding ﬁlters are
explicitly encoded in the model. Here, we replace the ﬁrst convolutional layer with a ﬁxed thresholding
layer consisting of two channels, ReLU (x "filter )andReLU (1 x "filter ), wherexis the input
image. Figure 3 shows results for networks trained with such a thresholding layer. For standard
trained networks, we use a value of "filter = 0:1for the thresholding ﬁlters, whereas for adversarially
trained networks we set "filter ="train . For each data subset size and test perturbation "test, we plot
the best test accuracy achieved over networks trained with different thresholding ﬁlters, i.e., different
values of". We separately show the effect of explicit thresholding in such networks when they are
trained adversarially using PGD.
As predicted by our theory, the networks achieve good adversarially robust generalization with
signiﬁcantly fewer samples when thresholding ﬁlters are added. Further, note that adding a simple
thresholding layer directly yields nearly state-of-the-art robustness against moderately strong adver-
saries ("= 0:1), without any other modiﬁcations to the model architecture or training algorithm. It
is also worth noting that the thresholding ﬁlters could have been learned by the original network
architecture, and that this modiﬁcation only decreases the capacity of the model. Our ﬁndings
emphasize network architecture as a crucial factor for learning adversarially robust networks from a
limited number of samples.
We also experimented with thresholding ﬁlters on the CIFAR10 dataset, but did not observe any
signiﬁcant difference from the standard architecture. This agrees with our theoretical understanding
that thresholding helps primarily in the case of (approximately) binary datasets.
4 Related Work
Due to the large body of work on adversarial robustness, we focus on related papers that also provide
theoretical explanations for adversarial examples. We defer a detailed discussion of related work to
Appedix A and discuss here the works most closely related to ours.
Wang et al. [55] study the adversarial robustness of nearest neighbor classiﬁers. In contrast to our
work, the authors give theoretical guarantees for a speciﬁc classiﬁcation algorithm, and do not
see a separation in sample complexity between robust and regular generalization. Recent work by
Gilmer et al. [20] explores a speciﬁc distribution where robust learning is empirically difﬁcult with
overparametrized neural networks. The main phenomenon is that even a small natural error rate
on their dataset translates to a large adversarial error rate. Our results give a more nuanced picture
that involves the sample complexity required for generalization. In our data models, it is possible to
achieve an error rate that is essentially zero by using a very small number of samples, whereas the
adversarial error rate is still large unless we have seen a lot of samples.
The work of Xu et al. [58] establishes a connection between robust optimization and regularization
for linear classiﬁcation. In particular, they show that robustness to a speciﬁc perturbation set is exactly
equivalent to the standard support vector machine. Subsequent work by Xu and Mannor [57] builds
a deeper connection between robustness and generalization. They prove that for a certain notion
of robustness, robust algorithms generalize. Moreover, they show that robustness is a necessary
8condition for generalization in an asymptotic sense. Bellet and Habrard [5]gives similar results
for metric learning. However, these results do no imply sample complexity bounds since they are
asymptotic. Our results stand in stark contrast: we show that generalization can, in simple models, be
signiﬁcantly easier than robustness when sample complexity enters the picture.
Fawzi et al. [18] relate the robustness of linear and non-linear classiﬁers to adversarial and
(semi-) random perturbations. Their work studies the setting where the classiﬁer is ﬁxed and does not
encompass the learning task. Fawzi et al. [19] give provable lower bounds for adversarial robustness
in models where robust classiﬁers do not exist. In contrast, we are interested in a setting where robust
classiﬁers exist, but need many samples to learn. Papernot et al. [43] discuss adversarial robustness at
the population level. We defer a more detailed discussion of these works to Appendix A.
There is also a long line of work in machine learning on exploring the connection between various no-
tions of margin and generalization, e.g., see [ 46] and references therein. In this setting, the `pmargin,
i.e., how robustly classiﬁable the data is for `
p-bounded classiﬁers, enables dimension-independent
control of the sample complexity. However, the sample complexity in concrete distributional models
can often be signiﬁcantly smaller than what the margin implies.
5 Discussion and Conclusions
The vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial perturbations has recently been a source of much
discussion and is still poorly understood. Different works have argued that this vulnerability stems
from their discontinuous nature [ 51], their linear nature [ 21], or is a result of high-dimensional
geometry and independent of the model class [ 20]. Our work gives a more nuanced picture. We show
that for a natural data distribution (the Gaussian model), the model class we train does not matter and
a standard linear classiﬁer achieves optimal robustness. However, robustness also strongly depends on
properties of the underlying data distribution. For other data models (such as MNIST or the Bernoulli
model), our results demonstrate that non-linearities are indispensable to learn from few samples. This
dichotomy provides evidence that defenses against adversarial examples need to be tailored to the
speciﬁc dataset (even for the same type of perturbations) and hence may be more complicated than a
single, broad approach. Understanding the interactions between robustness, classiﬁer model, and
data distribution from the perspective of generalization is an important direction for future work. We
refer the reader to Section B in the appendix for concrete questions in this direction.
The focus of our paper is on adversarial perturbations in a setting where the test distribution (before
the adversary’s action) is the same as the training distribution. While this is a natural scenario from a
security point of view, other setups can be more relevant in different robustness contexts. For instance,
we may want a classiﬁer that is robust to small changes between the training and test distribution.
This can be formalized as the classiﬁcation accuracy on unperturbed examples coming from an
adversarially modiﬁed distribution. Here, the power of the adversary is limited by how much the
test distribution can be modiﬁed, and the adversary is not allowed to perturb individual samples
coming from the modiﬁed test distribution. Interestingly, our lower bound for the Gaussian model
also applies to such worst-case distributional shifts. In particular, if the adversary is allowed to shift
the mean?by a vector inB"
1, our proof sketched in Section C transfers to the distribution shift
setting. Since the lower bound relies only on a single universal perturbation, this perturbation can
also be applied directly to the mean vector.
What do our results mean for robust classiﬁcation of real images? Our Gaussian lower bound implies
that if an algorithm works for all (or most) settings of the unknown parameter ?, then achieving
strong`1-robustness requires a sample complexity increase that is polynomial in the dimension.
There are a few different ways this lower bound could be bypassed. It is conceivable that the noise
scaleis signiﬁcantly smaller for real image datasets, making robust classiﬁcation easier. Even if that
was not the case, a good algorithm could work for the parameters ?that correspond to real datasets
while not working for most other parameters. To accomplish this, the algorithm would implicitly
or explicitly have prior information about the correct ?. While some prior information is already
incorporated in the model architectures (e.g., convolutional and pooling layers), the conventional
wisdom usually is not to bias the neural network with our priors. Our work suggests that there are
trade-offs with robustness here and that adding more prior information could help to learn more
robust classiﬁers.
