Abstract
A natural evaluation metric for statistical
topic models is the probability of held-out
documents given a trained model. While
exact computation of this probability is in-
tractable, several estimators for this prob-
ability have been used in the topic model-
ing literature, including the harmonic mean
method and empirical likelihood method. In
this paper, we demonstrate experimentally
that commonly-used methods are unlikely to
accurately estimate the probability of held-
out documents, and propose two alternative
methods that are both accurate and ecient.
1. Introduction
Statistical topic modeling is an increasingly useful
tool for analyzing large unstructured text collections.
There is a signicant body of work introducing and
developing sophisticated topic models and their appli-
cations. To date, however, there have not been any
papers specically addressing the issue of evaluating
topic models. Evaluation is an important issue: the
unsupervised nature of topic models makes model se-
lection dicult. For some applications there may be
extrinsic tasks, such as information retrieval or docu-
ment classication, for which performance can be eval-
uated. However, there is a need for a universal method
that measures the generalization capability of a topic
model in a way that is accurate, computationally e-
cient, and independent of any specic application.
Appearing in Proceedings of the 26thInternational Confer-
ence on Machine Learning , Montreal, Canada, 2009. Copy-
right 2009 by the author(s)/owner(s).In this paper we consider only the simplest topic
model, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and compare
a number of methods for estimating the probability
of held-out documents given a trained model. Most
of the methods presented, however, are applicable to
more complicated topic models. In addition to com-
paring evaluation methods that are currently used in
the topic modeling literature, we propose several al-
ternative methods. We present empirical results on
synthetic and real-world data sets showing that the
currently-used estimators are less accurate and have
higher variance than the proposed new estimators.
2. Latent Dirichlet allocation
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), originally intro-
duced by Blei et al. (2003), is a generative model for
text. In this model, a \topic" tis a discrete distribu-
tion over words with probability vector t. Dirichlet
priors, with concentration parameter and base mea-
suren, are placed over the topics = f1;:::Tg:
P() =Q
tDir (t;n): (1)
Each document, indexed by d, is assumed to have its
own distribution over topics given by probabilities d.
The priors over  = f1;:::Dgare also Dirichlet,
with concentration parameter 
and base measure m:
P() =Q

m): (2)

A data set of documents W=fw(1);w(2);:::;w(D)g
is observed, while the underlying corresponding topic
assignmentsZ=fz(1);z(2);:::;z(D)gare unobserved.
Conjugacy of Dirichlets with multinomials allows the
parameters to be marginalized out. For example,

3. Evaluating LDA
LDA is typically evaluated by either measuring perfor-
mance on some secondary task, such as document clas-
sication or information retrieval, or by estimating the
probability of unseen held-out documents given some
training documents. A better model will give rise to a
higher probability of held-out documents, on average.
The probability of a set of held-out documents Wgiven
a set of training documents W0, can be written as
P(WjW0)=Z
d d
dmP(Wj;
m)P(;
mjW0):
This integral can be approximated by averaging
P(Wj;
m) under samples from P(;
mjW0), or
evaluating at a point estimate. We take the latter ap-
proach. Variational methods (Blei et al., 2003) and
MCMC methods (Griths & Steyvers, 2004) are ef-
fective at marginalizing out the topic assignments Z
associated with the training data to infer  and 
m.
In this paper, we focus on evaluating
P(Wj;
m) =Q
dP(w(d)j;
m): (6)
Since the topic assignments for one document are in-
dependent of the topic assignments for all other docu-
ments, each held-out document can be evaluated sep-
arately. For the rest of this paper, we refer to the
current document as w, its latent topic assignments
asz, and its document-specic topic distribution as .
Many of the evaluation methods in this paper require
the ability to obtain a set of topic assignments zfor
documentwusing Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling
involves sequentially resampling each znfrom its con-
ditional posterior given w, ,
mandznn(the current
latent topic assignments for all other tokens):
P(zn=tjw;znn;;
m)
/P(wnjzn=t;)P(zn=tjznn;
m)
/wnjtfNtgnn+
mt
N 1 +
; (7)wherefNtgnnis the number of times topic toccurs in
the document in question, excluding position n, and
Nis the total number of tokens in the document.
4. Estimating P(wj;
m)
The evaluation probability P(wj;
m) for held-out
documentwcan be thought of as the normalizing con-
stant that relates the posterior distribution over zto
the joint distribution over wandzin Bayes' rule:
P(zjw;;
m) =P(z;wj;
m)
P(wj;
m): (8)
There are many existing methods for estimating nor-
malizing constants. In this section, we review some of
these methods, as previously applied to topic models,
and also outline two alternative methods: a Chib-style
estimator and a \left-to-right" evaluation algorithm.
4.1. Importance sampling methods
In general, given a model with observed variables
wand unknown variables h, importance sampling
can be used to approximate the probability of the
observed variables, either P(w) =P
hP(w;h) orR
dhP(w;h). IfQ(h) is some simple, tractable distri-
bution overh|the \proposal distribution"|then
P(w)'1
SX
sP(w;h(s))
Q(h(s));h(s)Q(h);(9)
is an unbiased estimator. To ensure low variance, Q(h)
must be similar to the \target distribution" P(hjw)
and must be non-zero wherever P(w;h) is non-zero.
In this section, we explain how P(wj;
m) can be
estimated using importance sampling by either (a) in-
tegrating out and using the prior over h=zas the
proposal distribution, or (b) using the prior over h=
as the proposal distribution, thereby allowing the topic
assignmentszto be marginalized out directly.
If the proposal distribution is the prior over z,
P(wj;
m) =X
zP(wjz;)P(zj
m)
'1
SX
sP(wjz(s);); (10)
wherez(s)P(zj
m). Unfortunately, topic assign-
ments drawn from the prior, without consideration of
the corresponding tokens, are unlikely to provide a
good explanation of w. The prior is not usually close
to the target distribution unless wis very short.
Better proposal distributions for z(s)can be con-
structed by taking winto account. The simplest wayEvaluation Methods for Topic Models
is to form a distribution over topics for each token
wn, ignoring dependencies between tokens: Q(zn)/

mznwnjzn. A more sophisticated method, which we
call \iterated pseudo-counts," involves iteratively up-
datingQ(zn) every sampling iteration. After initializ-
ingQ(zn)(0)/
mznwnjzn, the update rule is
Q(zn)(s)/(
mzn+X
n06=nQ(zn0)(s 1))wnjzn:(11)
Alternatively, P(wj;
m) can be written as an inte-
gral over the document-specic topic distribution :
P(wj;
m) =Z
dP(wj;)P(j
m)
'1
SX
sP(wj(s);); (12)
where(s)is drawn from P(j
m) = Dir (;
m).
The estimator in (12) is easily computed because the
topic assignments are independent given :
P(wj(s);) =Y
nP(wnj(s);)
=Y
nX
znP(wn;znj(s);):(13)
If the probabilities P(wj(s);) are estimated from
a synthetic document, randomly-generated using (s),
the resultant estimator corresponds to the empiri-
cal likelihood method described by Li and McCal-
lum (2006). Used directly, however, (13) will give
the same result as using innitely long synthetic doc-
uments and is how the empirical likelihood method is
implemented in MALLET (McCallum, 2002).
Importance sampling does not work well when sam-
pling from high-dimensional distributions. Unless the
proposal distribution is a near-perfect approximation
to the target distribution, the variance of the estimator
will be very large. When sampling continuous values,
such as, the estimator may have innite variance.
4.2. Harmonic mean method
The harmonic mean method (Newton & Raftery, 1994)
is based on the following unbiased estimator:
1
P(w)=X
zP(zjw)
P(wjz)'1
SX
s1
P(wjz(s));(14)
wherez(s)is drawn from P(zjw). Conditioning on 

mgives an estimator for P(wj;
m):

P(wjz(s);)
= HM (fP(wjz(s);)gS
s=1);(15)wherez(s)P(zjw;;
m) and HM () denotes the
harmonic mean. In practice, fz(s)gS
s=1areSsamples
taken from a Gibbs sampler after a burn-in period of
Biterations. Since the samples are used to approx-
imate an expectation, they need not be independent
and thinning is unnecessary. Consequently, the cost of
the estimator is that of S+BGibbs iterations.
Newton and Raftery (1994) expressed reservations
about the harmonic mean method when introducing it,
and Neal added further criticism in the discussion. De-
spite these criticisms, it has been used in several topic
modeling papers (Griths & Steyvers, 2004; Griths
et al., 2005; Wallach, 2006), due to its ease of imple-
mentation and relative computational eciency.
4.3. Annealed importance sampling
Annealed importance sampling (AIS) can be viewed
as a variant of simple importance sampling dened on
a higher-dimensional state space (Neal, 2001). Many
auxiliary variables are introduced in order to make the
proposal distribution closer to the target distribution.
When used to approximate P(wj;
m), AIS uses the
following sequence of probability distributions:
Ps(z)/P(wjz;)sP(zj
m);
dened by a set of \inverse temperatures," 0 = 0<
1<:::< S= 1. When s= 0,s= 0 and so P0(z) is
the prior distribution P(zj
m). Similarly, when s=
S,PS(z) is the posterior distribution P(zjw;;
m).
Intermediate values of sinterpolate between the prior
and posterior distributions. For each s= 1;:::;S 1,
a Markov chain transition operator Ts(z0 z) that
leavesPs(z) invariant must also be dened. When
approximating P(wj;
m),Ts(z0 z) is the Gibbs
sampling operator that samples sequentially from
Ps(znjznn)/P(wnjzn;)sP(znjznn;
m):(16)
Sampling from (16) is as easy as sampling from (7).
AIS builds a proposal distribution Q(Z) over the ex-
tended state space Z=fz(1);:::;z(S)gby rst sam-
pling from the tractable prior P0(z) and then applying
a series of transition operators T1;T2;:::;TS 1that
\move" the sample through the intermediate distribu-
tionsPs(z) towards the posterior PS(z). The proba-
bility of the resultant state sequence Zis given by
Q(Z) =P0(z(1))S 1Y
s=1Ts(z(s+1) z(s)): (17)
The target distribution for the proposal Q(Z) is
P(Z) =PS(z(S))S 1Y
s=1eTs(z(s) z(s+1)); (18)Evaluation Methods for Topic Models

Having sampled a sequence of topic assignments from
Q(Z), a scalar importance weight is constructed:
wAIS=P(wj;
m)P(Z)
Q(Z)
=P(w;z(S)j;
m)QS 1
s=1eTs(z(s) z(s+1))
P0(z(1))QS 1
s=1Ts(z(s+1) z(s))
=SY
s=1P(wjz(s);)s s 1:
Given a set of samples from Q(Z), the correspond-
ing importance weights can be used to approximate
P(wj;
m) because of the following equality:
P(wj;
m) =P(wj;
m)X
ZP(Z)
=EQ(Z)[wAIS]: (20)
The transition operators do not necessarily need to
be ergodic. The simple importance sampling approx-
imation in (10), in which the proposal distribution is
P(zj
m), is recovered by using transition operators
that do nothing: Ts(z0 z) =(z0 z) for alls.
The AIS algorithm is summarized in algorithm 1.
4.4. Chib-style estimation
For any \special" set of latent topic assignments z?,
Bayes' rule gives rise to the following identity:
P(wj;
m) =P(z?;wj;
m)
P(z?jw;;
m): (21)
Chib (1995) introduced a family of estimators that
rst pick az?and then estimate the denominator,
P(z?jw;;
m). The numerator P(z?;wj;
m) =
P(wjz?;)P(z?j
m) is known from (4) and (5).

mate the desired probability in expectation. Instead,
they constructed the following proposal distribution:
Q(Z) =1

s0=s+1T(z(s0) z(s0 1))

s0=1eT(z(s0) z(s0+1)):
Since the forward operator transition Tconsists of se-
quentially applying (7) for positions 1 to N(in that
order), the reverse transition operator eTcan be con-
structed by simply applying (7) in the reverse order.
Using the denition of eTin (19) it can be shown that

ing (7) for positions 1 ;:::;N , after a few iterations of
regular Gibbs sampling. In all our experiments, less
than 1% of computer time was spent setting z?.

4.5. \Left-to-right" evaluation algorithm
Another approach for approximating P(wj;
m)
was recently proposed by Wallach (2008). This
method, which operates in an incremental, \left-to-
right" fashion, decomposes P(wj;
m) as
P(wj;
m) =Q
nP(wnj;
m)
=Q
nP

Each sum over zncan then be approximated us-
ing an approach inspired by sequential Monte Carlo
methods (Del Moral et al., 2006), as in algo-
rithm 3. This method is appropriate for a wider range
of applications|including predictive text entry and
speech recognition systems|than the other methods
in this section, because of its \left-to-right" operation.
4.6. Relative costs of the methods
The majority of the methods described above are
based on Gibbs sampling, which dominates their costs:
computing P(znjwn;znn;;
m) is signicantly more
costly than computing P(wnjzn;)|the quantity
used to construct the estimators given the samples.
The Chib-style method is an exception: constructing
the estimator itself has a cost roughly equal to that of
Gibbs sampling. None-the-less, the approximate cost
of each method can be reported in terms of the num-
ber of Gibbs sampling site updates required (i.e., the
number ofznvariables updated) as shown in table 1.
Importance sampling using the prior over as the sam-
pling distribution does not involve Gibbs sampling.
However,P
znP(zn;wnj(s);) must be computed
for each held-out token wn, which has a similar cost
to a Gibbs sampling site update. The cost of sim-
ple importance sampling using a distribution over zis
harder to express, and will be implementation depen-
dent. Slightly unfairly to these methods, we assume
that the cost of generating samples is directly compa-1: initialize 0 = 0< 1<:::< S= 1

rable to Gibbs sampling. The cost could be examined
more closely were such a method to yield good results.
5. Document completion
Another way of evaluating topic models is to com-
pare predictive performance by estimating the prob-
ability of the second half of a document, given the
rst (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004). This is typically accom-
plished by adding the rst half of each held-out docu-
ment to the training data, while retaining the second
half for evaluation. Letting w(1)be the rst half of w
andw(2)be the second half, the goal is to compute
P(w(2)jw(1);;
m) =P(w(2);w(1)j;
m)
P(w(1)j;
m);(26)
which is a ratio of normalizing constants. Any
of the methods for estimating P(wj;
m)
P(w(2);w(1)j;
m) described in the previous sec-
tion can be re-run on only w(1)to estimate
P(w(1)j;
m), thereby allowing evaluation of (26).
However, specialized techniques may be more ecient.
5.1. Estimated 

can estimate P(w(2)jw(1);;

words inware ordered such that w(1)is fully ob-
served before any words from w(2)are observed, then
a second estimator can be accumulated as in line 12 of

In this section, we present experimental results com-
paring the evaluation methods described in the pre-
vious two sections on both real and synthetic data.
Our MATLAB and Java implementations are available
from http://www.cs.umass.edu/ ~wallach/code/etm/ .

Each of the three real-world data sets was divided into
training and held-out documents. For each data set,
,
andmvalues were inferred using the training
documents. Given these values, the evaluation meth-
ods were compared using the held-out documents. For
all three data sets the number of topics was set to 200.
Descriptions of all ve data sets are given in table 2.
6.2. Estimating P(wj;
m)
For each of the ve data sets, P(wj;
m) was es-
timated for fty held-out documents. The evaluation
methods are summarized in table 1. Like Murray and
Salakhutdinov (2009), AIS with 10,000 temperatures
was intended as a gold standard. This method is com-
putationally expensive, but is often accurate. For theEvaluation Methods for Topic Models
harmonic mean method, B= 50;000 burn-in itera-
tions were used, followed by S= 50;000 Gibbs sam-
pling iterations (without any thinning). The compu-
tation time for this parameterization roughly matches
the computation time for AIS with 10,000 tempera-
tures. For each of the data sets, the Chib-style esti-
mator was run with two di
erent parameterizations:
S= 1;000 andS= 2;000. The remaining meth-
ods were also run with two parameterizations, chosen
to result in computation times equivalent to those of
the Chib-style estimator (which are much smaller than
those of either AIS or the harmonic mean method).
For each method and data set, the estimates of
P(w(d)j;
m) for each held-out document w(d)were
averaged over 10 runs, to give P(w(d)j;
m). The
log probability of the held-out documents was then
estimated asP
dlogP(w(d)j;
m). Standard devi-
ations were obtained using a bootstrap method, in
which 10,000 log probabilities for each data set were
obtained by sampling with replacement from the 10
runs for each held-out document. Figure 1 showsP
dlogP(w(d)j;
m) for each method and data set.
The harmonic mean method wildly overestimatedP
dlogP(w(d)j;
m) for all of the data sets. Es-
timates were e
ectively from one or very few samples,
making the harmonic mean method very unstable.
The main failure mode for the simple importance sam-
pling methods, AIS and the Chib-style estimator is in-
adequately sampling the upper tail of the distribution
over importance weights. This causes underestimation
of bothP(wj;
m) and the variance of the estima-
tor. Consequently, the largest estimate is likely to be
the best. Formal statements could be made using the
bounds discussed by Gogate et al. (2007). AIS exhib-
ited this failure mode on the 20 Newsgroups data set,
yielding a lower probability than the \left-to-right" al-
gorithm due to poor performance on some long docu-
ments. Increasing the accuracy by using 20,000 tem-
peratures gave larger probabilities in agreement with
the \left-to-right" algorithm. Long documents in the
synthetic data set with only 3 topics also caused AIS
to exhibit higher variance than other methods.
The Chib-style estimator and the \left-to-right" algo-
rithm both performed well, with the latter consistently
performing better on the real-world data sets. Results
on the synthetic data sets show that the \left-to-right"
algorithm does not universally dominate the Chib-
style method, however. While more accurate than har-
monic mean, none of the simpler importance sampling
methods were competitive and generally performed ex-
ceedingly poorly, usually giving large underestimates.
The \iterated pseudo-counts" method was the best of

the simple importance sampling methods, but was still
signicantly worse than the Chib-style estimator.
6.3. Document completion
Another way of evaluating topic models is to esti-
mateP(w(2)jw(1);;
m). As explained in section 5,
this probability can be directly approximated using
either the estimated method, the \left-to-right" al-
gorithm or AIS. These methods were compared us-
ingB= 5;000 burn-in iterations and S= 20;000
samples for the estimated method,B= 500 burn-
in iterations and 1 ;500 temperatures for AIS, and
R= 42000=Nparticles for the \left-to-right" algo-
rithm. Despite being allowed signicantly more com-
putation time than the other methods, the estimated 
method exhibited relatively poor performance and did
not achieve results close to those of AIS. The \left-to-
right" algorithm did approach the estimates obtained
using AIS, with substantially less computation time.
6.4. Sensitivity to perturbations in andm
In this section, we investigate how the evaluation
methods described in sections 4 and 5 are a
ected by
perturbations in  and m. The methods were com-
pared using the synthetic data set with 50 topics, for
which the true , 
andmvalues are known.
Sensitivity to perturbations in  was investigated by
interpolating between  and a randomly-generated
set of topic-specic distribution over words 0. For
each method, either P(wj(1 )  +0;
m) or
P(w(2)jw(1);(1 )  +0;
m) were calculated for
2f0;:25;:5;:75g. Figure 3 shows the log ratios be-
tween the values computed using interpolated parame-
ters and the values computed using  only ( = 0) for
the estimated method, importance sampling from
P(j
m) and the \left-to-right" algorithm. Results
for the Chib-style estimator closely track those of the
\left-to-right" algorithm, so we report only the latter.

di

Sensitivity to perturbations in the base measure m

erated and either P(wj;

7. Discussion
The evaluation methods currently used in the topic
modeling community, including the harmonic mean
method, importance sampling from P(j
m), and
document completion methods, are generally inaccu-
rate. Even if these methods do result in a correct rank-
ing of di
erent models, the relative advantage of one
model over another may be incorrectly represented.
Most of the evaluation methods described in this pa-
per extend readily to more complicated topic models|
including non-parametric versions based on hierarchi-
cal Dirichlet processes (Teh et al., 2006)|since they
only require a MCMC algorithm for sampling the la-
tent topic assignments zfor each document and a way
of evaluating probability P(wjz;;
m). Importance
sampling from P(j
m) is not obviously directly ap-
plicable to non-parametric topic models, however.
Estimating the probability of held-out documents pro-
vides a clear, interpretable metric for evaluating the
performance of topic models relative to other topic-
based models as well as to other non-topic-based gen-
erative models. We provide empirical evidence that
several recently-used methods for estimating the prob-
ability of held-out documents are inaccurate and canchange the results of model comparison. In contrast,
the Chib-style estimator and \left-to-right" algorithm
presented in this paper provide a clear methodology
for accurately assessing and selecting topic models.
