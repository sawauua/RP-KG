Abstract
Recent studies have demonstrated the efﬁciency of generative pretraining for En-
glish natural language understanding. In this work, we extend this approach to
multiple languages and show the effectiveness of cross-lingual pretraining. We
propose two methods to learn cross-lingual language models (XLMs): one unsu-
pervised that only relies on monolingual data, and one supervised that leverages
parallel data with a new cross-lingual language model objective. We obtain state-of-
the-art results on cross-lingual classiﬁcation, unsupervised and supervised machine
translation. On XNLI, our approach pushes the state of the art by an absolute gain
of 4.9% accuracy. On unsupervised machine translation, we obtain 34.3 BLEU on
WMT’16 German-English, improving the previous state of the art by more than 9
BLEU. On supervised machine translation, we obtain a new state of the art of 38.5
BLEU on WMT’16 Romanian-English, outperforming the previous best approach
by more than 4 BLEU. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available1.
1 Introduction
Generative pretraining of sentence encoders [ 30,20,14] has led to strong improvements on numerous
natural language understanding benchmarks [ 40]. In this context, a Transformer [ 38] language model
is learned on a large unsupervised text corpus, and then ﬁne-tuned on natural language understanding
(NLU) tasks such as classiﬁcation [ 35] or natural language inference [ 7,42]. Although there has
been a surge of interest in learning general-purpose sentence representations, research in that area
has been essentially monolingual, and largely focused around English benchmarks [ 10,40]. Recent
developments in learning and evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations in many languages
[12] aim at mitigating the English-centric bias and suggest that it is possible to build universal
cross-lingual encoders that can encode any sentence into a shared embedding space.
In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-lingual language model pretraining on multiple
cross-lingual understanding (XLU) benchmarks. Precisely, we make the following contributions:
1.We introduce a new unsupervised method for learning cross-lingual representations using
cross-lingual language modeling and investigate two monolingual pretraining objectives.
2.We introduce a new supervised learning objective that improves cross-lingual pretraining
when parallel data is available.
3.We signiﬁcantly outperform the previous state of the art on cross-lingual classiﬁcation,
unsupervised machine translation and supervised machine translation.
4.We show that cross-lingual language models can provide signiﬁcant improvements on the
perplexity of low-resource languages.
5. We make our code and pretrained models publicly available1.

33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.2 Related Work
Our work builds on top of Radford et al. [30], Howard and Ruder [20], Devlin et al. [14] who
investigate language modeling for pretraining Transformer encoders. Their approaches lead to drastic
improvements on several classiﬁcation tasks from the GLUE benchmark [ 40]. Ramachandran et al.
[31] show that language modeling pretraining can also provide signiﬁcant improvements on machine
translation tasks, even for high-resource language pairs such as English-German where there exists a
signiﬁcant amount of parallel data. Concurrent to our work, results on cross-lingual classiﬁcation
using a cross-lingual language modeling approach were showcased on the BERT repository . We
compare those results to our approach in Section 5.
Aligning distributions of text representations has a long tradition, starting from word embeddings
alignment and the work of Mikolov et al. [27] that leverages small dictionaries to align word
representations from different languages. A series of follow-up studies show that cross-lingual
representations can be used to improve the quality of monolingual representations [ 16], that orthogonal
transformations are sufﬁcient to align these word distributions [ 43], and that all these techniques
can be applied to an arbitrary number of languages [ 2]. Following this line of work, the need for
cross-lingual supervision was further reduced [ 34] until it was completely removed [ 11]. We take
these ideas one step further by aligning distributions of sentences and also reducing the need for
parallel data.
There is a large body of work on aligning sentence representations from multiple languages. By
using parallel data, Hermann and Blunsom [18], Conneau et al. [12], Eriguchi et al. [15] investigated
zero-shot cross-lingual sentence classiﬁcation. But the most successful recent approach of cross-
lingual encoders is probably the one of Johnson et al. [21] for multilingual machine translation.
They show that a single sequence-to-sequence model can be used to perform machine translation
for many language pairs, by using a single shared LSTM encoder and decoder. Their multilingual
model outperformed the state of the art on low-resource language pairs, and enabled zero-shot
translation. Following this approach, Artetxe and Schwenk [4]show that the resulting encoder can be
used to produce cross-lingual sentence embeddings. By leveraging more than 200 million parallel
sentences, they obtain a new state of the art on the XNLI cross-lingual classiﬁcation benchmark
[12]. While these methods require a signiﬁcant amount of parallel data, recent work in unsupervised
machine translation show that sentence representations can be aligned in a completely unsupervised
way [ 25,5]. For instance, Lample et al. [26] obtained 25.2 BLEU on WMT’16 German-English
without using parallel sentences. Similarly, we show that we can align distributions of sentences in a
completely unsupervised way, and that our cross-lingual models can be used for a broad set of natural
language understanding tasks, including machine translation.
The most similar work to ours is probably the one of Wada and Iwata [39], where the authors train a
LSTM [ 19] language model with sentences from different languages to align word embeddings in an
unsupervised way.
3 Cross-lingual language models
In this section, we present the three language modeling objectives we consider throughout this work.
Two of them only require monolingual data (unsupervised), while the third one requires parallel
sentences (supervised). We consider Nlanguages. Unless stated otherwise, we suppose that we have
Nmonolingual corpora fCigi=1:::N, and we denote by nithe number of sentences in Ci.
3.1 Shared sub-word vocabulary
In all our experiments we process all languages with the same shared vocabulary created through Byte
Pair Encoding (BPE) [ 32]. As shown in Lample et al. [25], this greatly improves the alignment of
embedding spaces across languages that share either the same alphabet or anchor tokens such as digits
[34] or proper nouns. We learn the BPE splits on the concatenation of sentences sampled randomly
from the monolingual corpora. Sentences are sampled according to a multinomial distribution with
probabilitiesfqigi=1:::N, where:qi=p

iPN
j=1p

jwithpi=niPN
k=1nk:We consider 
= 0:5.
Sampling with this distribution increases the number of tokens associated to low-resource languages
2and alleviates the bias towards high-resource languages. In particular, this prevents words of low-
resource languages from being split at the character level.
3.2 Causal Language Modeling (CLM)
Our causal language modeling (CLM) task consists of a Transformer language model trained to model
the probability of a word given the previous words in a sentence P(wtjw1;:::;w t 1;). While
recurrent neural networks obtain state-of-the-art performance on language modeling benchmarks
[22], Transformer models are also very competitive [ 13]. In the case of LSTM language models,
back-propagation through time [ 41] (BPTT) is performed by providing the LSTM with the last hidden
state of the previous iteration. In the case of Transformers, previous hidden states can be passed to
the current batch [ 1] to provide context to the ﬁrst words in the batch. However, this technique does
not scale to the cross-lingual setting, so we just leave the ﬁrst words in each batch without context for
simplicity.
3.3 Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
We also consider the masked language modeling (MLM) objective of Devlin et al. [14], also known as
the Cloze task [ 36]. Following Devlin et al. [14], we sample randomly 15% of the BPE tokens from
the text streams, replace them by a [MASK] token 80% of the time, by a random token 10% of the
time, and we keep them unchanged 10% of the time. Differences between our approach and the MLM
of Devlin et al. [14] include the use of text streams of an arbitrary number of sentences (truncated at
256 tokens) instead of pairs of sentences. To counter the imbalance between rare and frequent tokens
(e.g. punctuations or stop words), we also subsample the frequent outputs using an approach similar
to Mikolov et al. [28]: tokens in a text stream are sampled according to a multinomial distribution,
whose weights are proportional to the square root of their invert frequencies. Our MLM objective is
illustrated in Figure 1.
3.4 Translation Language Modeling (TLM)
Both the CLM and MLM objectives are unsupervised and only require monolingual data. However,
these objectives cannot be used to leverage parallel data when it is available. We introduce a new
translation language modeling (TLM) objective for improving cross-lingual pretraining. Our TLM
objective is an extension of MLM, where instead of considering monolingual text streams, we
concatenate parallel sentences as illustrated in Figure 1. We randomly mask words in both the source
and target sentences. To predict a word masked in an English sentence, the model can either attend to
surrounding English words or to the French translation, encouraging the model to align the English
and French representations. In particular, the model can leverage the French context if the English
one is not sufﬁcient to infer the masked English words. To facilitate the alignment, we also reset the
positions of target sentences.
3.5 Cross-lingual Language Models
In this work, we consider cross-lingual language model pretraining with either CLM, MLM, or MLM
used in combination with TLM. For the CLM and MLM objectives, we train the model with batches
of 64 streams of continuous sentences composed of 256 tokens. At each iteration, a batch is composed
of sentences coming from the same language, which is sampled from the distribution fqigi=1:::N
above, with
= 0:7. When TLM is used in combination with MLM, we alternate between these two
objectives, and sample the language pairs with a similar approach.
4 Cross-lingual language model pretraining
In this section, we explain how cross-lingual language models can be used to obtain:

et al. [14], but with continuous streams of text as opposed to sentence pairs. The TLM objective extends MLM to
pairs of parallel sentences. To predict a masked English word, the model can attend to both the English sentence
and its French translation, and is encouraged to align English and French representations. Position embeddings
of the target sentence are reset to facilitate the alignment.
4.1 Cross-lingual classiﬁcation
Our pretrained XLM models provide general-purpose cross-lingual text representations. Similar to
monolingual language model ﬁne-tuning [ 30,14] on English classiﬁcation tasks, we ﬁne-tune XLMs
on a cross-lingual classiﬁcation benchmark. We use the cross-lingual natural language inference
(XNLI) dataset to evaluate our approach. Precisely, we add a linear classiﬁer on top of the ﬁrst
hidden state of the pretrained Transformer, and ﬁne-tune all parameters on the English NLI training
dataset. We then evaluate the capacity of our model to make correct NLI predictions in the 15 XNLI
languages. Following Conneau et al. [12], we also include machine translation baselines of train and
test sets. We report our results in Table 1.
4.2 Unsupervised Machine Translation
Pretraining is a key ingredient of unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) [ 25,5]. Lample
et al. [26] show that the quality of pretrained cross-lingual word embeddings used to initialize the
lookup table has a signiﬁcant impact on the performance of an unsupervised machine translation
model. We propose to take this idea one step further by pretraining the entire encoder and decoder
with a cross-lingual language model to bootstrap the iterative process of UNMT. We explore various
initialization schemes and evaluate their impact on several standard machine translation benchmarks,
including WMT’14 English-French, WMT’16 English-German and WMT’16 English-Romanian.
Results are presented in Table 2.
4.3 Supervised Machine Translation
We also investigate the impact of cross-lingual language modeling pretraining for supervised machine
translation, and extend the approach of Ramachandran et al. [31] to multilingual NMT [ 21]. We
evaluate the impact of both CLM and MLM pretraining on WMT’16 Romanian-English, and present
results in Table 3.
44.4 Low-resource language modeling
For low-resource languages, it is often beneﬁcial to leverage data in similar but higher-resource
languages, especially when they share a signiﬁcant fraction of their vocabularies. For instance, there
are about 100k sentences written in Nepali on Wikipedia, and about 6 times more in Hindi. These
two languages also have more than 80% of their tokens in common in a shared BPE vocabulary of
100k subword units. We provide in Table 4 a comparison in perplexity between a Nepali language
model and a cross-lingual language model trained in Nepali but enriched with different combinations
of Hindi and English data.
4.5 Unsupervised cross-lingual word embeddings
Conneau et al. [11] showed how to perform unsupervised word translation by aligning monolingual
word embedding spaces with adversarial training (MUSE). Lample et al. [25] showed that using a
shared vocabulary between two languages and then applying fastText [ 6] on the concatenation of their
monolingual corpora also directly provides high-quality cross-lingual word embeddings (Concat)
for languages that share a common alphabet. In this work, we also use a shared vocabulary but our
word embeddings are obtained via the lookup table of our cross-lingual language model (XLM).
In Section 5, we compare these three approaches on three different metrics: cosine similarity, L2
distance and cross-lingual word similarity.
5 Experiments and results
In this section, we empirically demonstrate the strong impact of cross-lingual language model
pretraining on several benchmarks, and compare our approach to the current state of the art.
5.1 Training details
In all experiments, we use a Transformer architecture with 1024 hidden units, 8 heads, GELU
activations [ 17], a dropout rate of 0.1 and learned positional embeddings. We train our models with
the Adam optimizer [23], a linear warm-up [38] and learning rates varying from 10 4to5:10 4.
For the CLM and MLM objectives, we use streams of 256tokens and a mini-batches of size 64.
Unlike Devlin et al. [14], a sequence in a mini-batch can contain more than two consecutive sentences,
as explained in Section 3.2. For the TLM objective, we sample mini-batches of 4000 tokens composed
of sentences with similar lengths. We use the averaged perplexity over languages as a stopping
criterion for training. For machine translation, we only use 6 layers, and we create mini-batches of
2000 tokens.
When ﬁne-tuning on XNLI, we use mini-batches of size 8or16, and we clip the sentence length
to 256 words. We use 80k BPE splits and a vocabulary of 95k and train a 12-layer model on the
Wikipedias of the XNLI languages. We sample the learning rate of the Adam optimizer with values
from 5:10 4to2:10 4, and use small evaluation epochs of 20000 random samples. We use the
ﬁrst hidden state of the last layer of the transformer as input to the randomly initialized ﬁnal linear
classiﬁer, and ﬁne-tune all parameters. In our experiments, using either max-pooling or mean-pooling
over the last layer did not work better than using the ﬁrst hidden state.
We implement all our models in PyTorch [ 29], and train them on 64 V olta GPUs for the language
modeling tasks, and 8 GPUs for the MT tasks. We use ﬂoat16 operations to speed up training and to
reduce the memory usage of our models.
5.2 Data preprocessing
We use WikiExtractor to extract raw sentences from Wikipedia dumps and use them as monolingual
data for the CLM and MLM objectives. For the TLM objective, we only use parallel data that
involves English, similar to Conneau et al. [12]. Precisely, we use MultiUN [ 44] for French, Spanish,
Russian, Arabic and Chinese, and the IIT Bombay corpus [ 3] for Hindi. We extract the following
corpora from the OPUS website Tiedemann [37]: the EUbookshop corpus for German, Greek and
Bulgarian, OpenSubtitles 2018 for Turkish, Vietnamese and Thai, Tanzil for both Urdu and Swahili
and GlobalV oices for Swahili. For Chinese and Thai we respectively use the tokenizer of Chang

et al. [9], and the PyThaiNLP tokenizer. For all other languages, we use the tokenizer provided by
Moses [ 24], falling back on the default English tokenizer when necessary. We use fastBPE to learn
BPE codes and split words into subword units. The BPE codes are learned on the concatenation of
sentences sampled from all languages, following the method presented in Section 3.1.
5.3 Results and analysis
In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-lingual language model pretraining. Our
approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the previous state of the art on cross-lingual classiﬁcation, unsu-
pervised and supervised machine translation.
Cross-lingual classiﬁcation In Table 1, we evaluate two types of pretrained cross-lingual encoders:
an unsupervised cross-lingual language model that uses the MLM objective on monolingual corpora
only; and a supervised cross-lingual language model that combines both the MLM and the TLM loss
using additional parallel data. Following Conneau et al. [12], we include two machine translation
baselines: TRANSLATE-TRAIN, where the English MultiNLI training set is machine translated into
each XNLI language, and TRANSLATE-TEST where every dev and test set of XNLI is translated to
English. We report the XNLI baselines of Conneau et al. [12], the multilingual BERT approach of
Devlin et al. [14] and the recent work of Artetxe and Schwenk [4].
Our fully unsupervised MLM method sets a new state of the art on zero-shot cross-lingual classiﬁca-
tion and signiﬁcantly outperforms the supervised approach of Artetxe and Schwenk [4] which uses
223 million of parallel sentences. Precisely, MLM obtains 71.5% accuracy on average ( ), while
they obtained 70.2% accuracy. By leveraging parallel data through the TLM objective (MLM+TLM),
we get a signiﬁcant boost in performance of 3.6% accuracy, improving even further the state of the
art to 75.1%. On the Swahili and Urdu low-resource languages, we outperform the previous state
of the art by 6.2% and 6.3% respectively. Using TLM in addition to MLM also improves English
accuracy from 83.2% to 85% accuracy, outperforming Artetxe and Schwenk [4]and Devlin et al.
[14] by 11.1% and 3.6% accuracy respectively.
When ﬁne-tuned on the training set of each XNLI language (TRANSLATE-TRAIN), our supervised
model outperforms our zero-shot approach by 1.6%, reaching an absolute state of the art of 76.7%
average accuracy. This result demonstrates the consistency of our approach and shows that XLMs
can be ﬁne-tuned on any language with strong performance. Similar to multilingual BERT [14], we
observe that TRANSLATE-TRAIN outperforms TRANSLATE-TEST by 2.5% average accuracy, and
additionally that our zero-shot approach outperforms TRANSLATE-TEST by 0.9%.
Unsupervised machine translation For the unsupervised machine translation task we consider 3
language pairs: English-French, English-German, and English-Romanian. Our setting is identical to
the one of Lample et al. [26], except for the initialization step where we use cross-lingual language
modeling to pretrain the full model as opposed to only the lookup table.

German-English and WMT’16 Romanian-English. For our results, the ﬁrst two columns indicate the
model used to pretrain the encoder and the decoder. “ - ” means the model was randomly initialized.
EMB corresponds to pretraining the lookup table with cross-lingual embeddings, CLM and MLM
correspond to pretraining with models trained on the CLM or MLM objectives.
For both the encoder and the decoder, we consider different possible initializations: CLM pretraining,
MLM pretraining, or random initialization. We then follow Lample et al. [26] and train the model
with a denoising auto-encoding loss along with an online back-translation loss. Results are reported
in Table 2. We compare our approach with the ones of Lample et al. [26]. For each language pair, we
observe signiﬁcant improvements over the previous state of the art. We re-implemented the NMT
approach of Lample et al. [26] (EMB), and obtained better results than reported in their paper. We
expect that this is due to our multi-GPU implementation which uses signiﬁcantly larger batches. In
German-English, our best model outperforms the previous unsupervised approach by more than 9.1
BLEU, and 13.3 BLEU if we only consider neural unsupervised approaches. Compared to pretraining
only the lookup table (EMB), pretraining both the encoder and decoder with MLM leads to consistent
signiﬁcant improvements of up to 7 BLEU on German-English. We also observe that the MLM
objective pretraining consistently outperforms the CLM one, going from 30.4 to 33.4 BLEU on
English-French, and from 28.0 to 31.8 on Romanian-English. These results are consistent with the
ones of Devlin et al. [14] who observed a better generalization on NLU tasks when training on the
MLM objective compared to CLM. We also observe that the encoder is the most important element
to pretrain: when compared to pretraining both the encoder and the decoder, pretraining only the
decoder leads to a signiﬁcant drop in performance, while pretraining only the encoder only has a
small impact on the ﬁnal BLEU score.
Supervised machine translation In Table 3 we report the performance on Romanian-English
WMT’16 for different supervised training conﬁgurations: mono-directional (ro !en), bidirectional
(ro$en, a multi-NMT model trained on both en !ro and ro!en) and bidirectional with back-
translation (ro$en + BT). Models with back-translation are trained with the same monolingual
data as language models used for pretraining. As in the unsupervised setting, we observe that
pretraining provides a signiﬁcant boost in BLEU score for each conﬁguration, and that pretraining
with the MLM objective leads to the best performance. Also, while models with back-translation
have access to the same amount of monolingual data as the pretrained models, they are not able
to generalize as well on the evaluation sets. Our bidirectional model trained with back-translation
obtains the best performance and reaches 38.5 BLEU, outperforming the previous SOTA of Sennrich
et al. [33] (based on back-translation and ensemble models) by more than 4 BLEU. Similar to
English-Romanian, we obtained a 1.5 BLEU improvement for English-German WMT’16 using MLM
7pretraining. For English-French WMT’14 which contains signiﬁcantly more supervised training data,
we only obtained a minor improvement of 0.1 BLEU, which tends to indicate that the gains coming
from pretraining are not as important for very high-resource settings than they are for lower-resource
languages. However, in all cases we observed that convergence with pretraining is extremely fast.
Typically, even for English-French, we observed that the model only needs a few epochs to converge.

Low-resource language model In Table 4, we investigate the impact of cross-lingual language
modeling for improving the perplexity of a Nepali language model. To do so, we train a Nepali
language model on Wikipedia, together with additional data from either English or Hindi. While
Nepali and English are distant languages, Nepali and Hindi are similar as they share the same
Devanagari script and have a common Sanskrit ancestor. When using English data, we reduce the
perplexity on the Nepali language model by 17.1 points, going from 157.2 for Nepali-only language
modeling to 140.1 when using English. Using additional data from Hindi, we get a much larger
perplexity reduction of 41.6. Finally, by leveraging data from both English and Hindi, we reduce
the perplexity even more to 109.3 on Nepali. The gains in perplexity from cross-lingual language
modeling can be partly explained by the n-grams anchor points that are shared across languages, for
instance in Wikipedia articles. The cross-lingual language model can thus transfer the additional
context provided by the Hindi or English monolingual corpora through these anchor points to improve
the Nepali language model.

Unsupervised cross-lingual word embeddings The MUSE, Concat and XLM (MLM) methods
provide unsupervised cross-lingual word embedding spaces that have different properties. In Table 5,
we study those three methods using the same word vocabulary and compute the cosine similarity
and L2 distance between word translation pairs from the MUSE dictionaries. We also evaluate
the quality of the cosine similarity measure via the SemEval’17 cross-lingual word similarity task
of Camacho-Collados et al. [8]. We observe that XLM outperforms both MUSE and Concat on
cross-lingual word similarity, reaching a Pearson correlation of 0.69. Interestingly, word translation
pairs are also far closer in the XLM cross-lingual word embedding space than for MUSE or Concat.
Speciﬁcally, MUSE obtains 0.38 and 5.13 for cosine similarity and L2 distance while XLM gives
0.55 and 2.64 for the same metrics. Note that XLM embeddings have the particularity of being
trained together with a sentence encoder which may enforce this closeness, while MUSE and Concat
are based on fastText word embeddings.
86 Conclusion
In this work, we show for the ﬁrst time the strong impact of cross-lingual language model (XLM)
pretraining. We investigate two unsupervised training objectives that require only monolingual
corpora: Causal Language Modeling (CLM) and Masked Language Modeling (MLM). We show
that both the CLM and MLM approaches provide strong cross-lingual features that can be used for
pretraining models. On unsupervised machine translation, we show that MLM pretraining is extremely
effective. We reach a new state of the art of 34.3 BLEU on WMT’16 German-English, outperforming
the previous best approach by more than 9 BLEU. Similarly, we obtain strong improvements on
supervised machine translation. We reach a new state of the art on WMT’16 Romanian-English of
38.5 BLEU, which corresponds to an improvement of more than 4 BLEU points. We also demonstrate
that XLMs can be used to improve the perplexity of a Nepali language model, and that it provides
unsupervised cross-lingual word embeddings. Without using a single parallel sentence, our MLM
model ﬁne-tuned on XNLI already outperforms the previous supervised state of the art by 1.3%
accuracy on average. Our translation language model objective (TLM) leverages parallel data to
improve further the alignment of sentence representations. When used together with MLM, we show
that this supervised approach beats the previous state of the art on XNLI by 4.9% accuracy on average.
Our code and pretrained models are publicly available.
